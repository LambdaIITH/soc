We expect you to:

* Be active on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/lambda_iith/LambdaSoC).
* Participate in weekly (online) meetings with your mentor.
* Review Pull Requests of other students and contributors. This is a big part of open
source work and we'll make sure to help you get started.
* All code you want to merge has to have full test coverage and documentation.
* If anything, for whatever reason, looks
to be problematic, talk to your mentor or an admin!

And Again:
__Get in contact with your mentors or the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise!__
