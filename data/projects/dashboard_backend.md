Dashboard is going to be the official app of IIT Hyderabad's Gymkhana. The aim is to bundle every academic, cultural, club-related activity, spendings by Gymkhana and anything fun/useful like lost and found, forums, academic portals (Classroom, Piazza, Canvas etc), interactive and dynamic timetables, etc into a single portal accessible to all students - your goto e-buddy in IITH that makes your life simple and organized amidst the chaos! The app will bring more transperacy in the Gymkhana activities and special emphasis will be given to make the details of budget and expenditures available to all.  The current repository (only in template state right now) is [here](https://github.com/LambdaIITH/Dashboard). The discussions so far have been done [on the #general channel on Slack](https://dashboard-lambda.slack.com/messages/general/) and other channels.

Backend for Dashboard targets to complete the backend parts of Dashboard and add the functionality to the frontend.
This includes server management, server-side modules for core-functionalities of all sections, database management, parsing of existing portals etc. 

From now onwards, discussions will be held [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/lambda_iith/LambdaSoC).
