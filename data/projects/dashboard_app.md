Dashboard is going to be the official app of IIT Hyderabad's Gymkhana. The aim is to bundle every academic, cultural, club-related activity, spendings by Gymkhana and anything fun/useful like lost and found, forums, mess menu, academic portals (Classroom, Piazza, Canvas etc), interactive and dynamic timetables, etc into a single portal accessible to all students - your goto e-buddy in IITH that makes your life simple and organized amidst the chaos! The app will bring more transperacy in the Gymkhana activities and special emphasis will be given to make the details of budget and expenditures available to all. The current repository (only in template state right now) is here. 

This project will involve you making an Android app which will be used by all the students in IITH. It should have the above mentioned features. It will communicate with Dashboard backend to get the data. The app shall have the following sections.
- Bus Schedules : The schedule of the bus for the day.
- Lost+Found : All the lost and found stuff should be here. Notifications if someone replies to your lost post.
- Reports : This section will serve as the reports for all the club/cultural activities. The user should also be able to see the detailed breakdown of the budget and expenditures.

Bonus : 
- Class Timetable : The user should be quickly able to see his/her next class with the details like room number etc. This is to be done if time is left after the completing the above.
